Edit "PATH\TO\YOUR\CLEANUP\FOLDER" accordingly and have fun. :)

This will delete all Titles and Tags from the files in the specified folder. It will also extract the Subtitles (if there are any), remove the first two lines and merge them back.

CAUTION: Do not use this on your movies/tv folder directly, it might remove desired subtitle lines.
